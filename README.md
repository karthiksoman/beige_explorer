# BEIGE explorer

This repo holds the script for the [web application](https://beige-explorer.herokuapp.com/) that allows the user to explore BEIGE vectors for medical concepts such as Disease, Symptom, Drug, SideEffect. It also allows the user to explore the biological features of BEIGE vector (for example, what are the top genes associated with Parkinson's disease)

Application has the following features:

- Explore BEIGE vectors in tSNE space (both 2D and 3D)
- Interactive feature to find the nearest neighbors of a biomedical concept in BEIGE vector space 
(for e.g. what are the top 20 concepts near the biomedical concept "Vertigo" in BEIGE vector space)
- Interactive feature to find the nearest neighbors based on their type
(for e.g. what are the top 20 "Diseases" near the biomedical concept "Vertigo" in BEIGE vector space)
- Interactive feature to find the top features of a biomedical concepts
(for e.g. what are the top 10 genes associated with Parkinson's disease)

This [web application](https://beige-explorer.herokuapp.com/), hence, will be helpful for the user to get an intuitive understanding of the BEIGE embedding vectors for biomedical concepts.
